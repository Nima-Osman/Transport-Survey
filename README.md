# Transport Systems in Wales, UK

## **Introduction**
Wales has developed a comprehensive public transport network shaped by its geography and growing population. 
Challenges with North-South travel have led to higher car ownership and public dissatisfaction. 
The Welsh government has made efforts to improve transport efficiency and public satisfaction. 
This report reviews a 2013-2014 survey to identify key areas for improvement in Wales' transportation system.

## Methodology
The dataset provided was pre-processed to ensure it was ready for analysis. 
Pre-processing included cleaning the data by addressing missing values and ensuring format consistency, 
integrating datasets, transforming data where necessary, normalising numerical features using 1NF normalisation, 
and reducing the data to eliminate redundancies while maintaining analytical quality.
<br>

Data analysis was conducted using Google Colab, with Pandas for data manipulation, 
Seaborn for visualisations, and Plotly for interactive charts. 
Although Excel was also used for certain tasks, the tools complemented each other, 
enabling efficient analysis and the creation of visually appealing results. 
Google Colab was chosen over VScode for convenience.
