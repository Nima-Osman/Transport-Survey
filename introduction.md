### Introduction

As defined in the data analytics plan, Wales has a comprehensive public transport network that evolved over time, influenced by the geography and history of the region. As the population grew, the demand for inter-urban roads increased due to the need for connectivity for work purposes. The difficulties in traveling between the North and South of Wales have increased car ownership as well as dissatisfaction with the general transportation systems in Wales. The Welsh government has implemented changes to increase the efficiency of transportation systems and, as a result, increase public satisfaction (Wales Assembly Government, 2008). This report assesses the findings of a survey carried out in 2013-2014 and interprets these results to gain valuable insight into areas that require improvement in the transportation system.
