## 5. Discussion/Analysis

The Wales transportation system has improved over the years, but understanding the evolving needs of the public, especially in rural areas, remains crucial due to the growing population and changes in the work industry. To make necessary improvements and increase satisfaction, it is vital to comprehend the public's requirements for transportation systems.

### Key Findings

- **Access to Healthcare Services**:
  - Results from the user satisfaction survey show that accessing hospitals and GPs received similar scores, with the majority finding it "easy" or "fairly easy" to access healthcare services (Figures 1 & 5). 
  - Certain demographics, such as those with very bad general health or over 75, faced difficulties. Physical limitations might contribute to their challenges, which are less related to the Wales transportation system and more to individual circumstances.
  - Car owners reported higher ease of accessing healthcare services, suggesting that public transport might be the cause of low scores rather than the state of the roads. Further information is needed to understand public views on public transport and the breakdown of car ownership versus public transport usage.

- **Age and Transportation**:
  - Age was highlighted as a factor in accessing healthcare services, with older people relying more on public transport, possibly due to reduced car usage, especially in retirement age. 
  - Investigating car usage by age in the 75+ demographic would help understand what percentage uses cars to access healthcare.

- **Overall Satisfaction**:
  - Demographics more likely to use public transport (e.g., over 75, 16-24, single pensioners, and non-employed individuals) reported higher satisfaction with the transportation system than car users.
  - Surprisingly, those deprived of services expressed higher satisfaction, raising questions about whether dissatisfaction is related more to car-related services than public transport.

- **Geographic Disparities**:
  - Scores of different local authorities were mapped, revealing bias in data collection towards South Wales, potentially skewing results (Figure 4).
  - North Wales had higher satisfaction scores, while central Wales had the lowest.

- **Safety Concerns**:
  - Feeling unsafe while traveling after dark increased with age (Figure 7). 
  - The 75+ age group had the lowest scores for feeling safe after dark, which may relate to increased public transport use.
  - Gender played a role, with males feeling almost twice as safe as females at night.
  - Investigating car users' safety perceptions and the accessibility of public transport after dark is essential.

- **Public Transport Frequency**:
  - Decreased service frequency at night may lead to longer wait times, contributing to feelings of unsafety.
  - Cardiff bus schedules showed a drop from every 16 minutes to every hour between 16:00-23:00 (Cardiff Bus, 2023). 
  - Ceredigion faced worse conditions, with no bus services available after 18:30 (Geopunk, 2023).

- **Comparison with TFL**:
  - TFL buses in London run more frequently, every 8-10 minutes during the day and 10-14 minutes at night (Transport for London, 2023).

### Conclusion
Ensuring better access to public transport, especially after dark, is essential for enhancing overall satisfaction with the transportation system in Wales. More comprehensive research and understanding of public needs are crucial for making informed improvements.

## 6. Limitations/Recommendations

1. **Data Limitations**:
   - A more comprehensive survey is needed to differentiate car users from public transport users and gather data on the state of the transportation system.
   - Correlation between car ownership and dissatisfaction should be further explored.

2. **Regional Representation**:
   - Include more local authorities in North Wales for a representative sample.
   - Assess differences between rural and urban areas, especially in accessing healthcare in secluded villages.

3. **Further Surveys**:
   - Conduct another user satisfaction survey to gauge current views on improvements to the transportation system.
   - Assess bike usage and gather opinions on increasing bike usage in cities and towns in Wales.

## 7. Implementation Plan

- **Support for Physically Limited Individuals**:
  - Collaborate with healthcare providers to offer transportation options, such as funded taxi services for patients.

- **Enhance Public Transport Services to Healthcare**:
  - Assess and improve public transport routes to hospitals and doctors' offices. Increase frequency and coverage, especially during nighttime hours, modeled on London's TFL system.

- **Optimize Bus Services in Smaller Areas**:
  - Review and align bus services in smaller towns with public needs during different hours of the day. Conduct surveys for deeper insights.

- **Increase Nighttime Safety**:
  - Collaborate with security companies or police to enhance nighttime safety, encouraging a greater sense of security. Conduct a trial period, followed by a survey to measure public response.

> **Note**: More detailed data is required for tailored and effective recommendations.
